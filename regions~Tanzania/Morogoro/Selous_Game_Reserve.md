> The Selous Game Reserve, now renamed as Nyerere National Park (in-part), 
> is a protected nature reserve and wilderness area in southern Tanzania, East Africa. 
> 
> It covers a total area of 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi), with additional buffer zones, as well. 
> It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, 
> owing to its high levels of biodiversity and vast, undisturbed natural landscapes, 
> such as the grasslands and the miombo woodlands habitat. 
> 
> Among the numerous species within the park are some of the continent's largest and most iconic 
> (and most vulnerable, threatened or endangered), such as the 
> - bush elephant, 
> - black rhinoceros, 
> - hippopotamus, 
> - lion, 
> - leopard, 
> - spotted hyena, 
> - painted dog, 
> - Cape buffalo, 
> - Masai giraffe, 
> - plains zebra, 
> - white-bearded gnu 
> - and the giant Nile crocodile. 
> 
> Due to the fragility and sensitivity of the many species and ecosystems within the park, 
> human habitation is not permitted within its bounds, and all persons entering and exiting are tallied 
> and tracked by the Wildlife Division of the Tanzanian Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism.
